  # Students should "watch" this repository to receive notifications for any
  # updates. It is highly recommended that students "fork" this repository and
  # make "pull requests". Course materials such as notes and source code files
  # will be posted at this repository. 

- Prerequisite: STAT 3375Q

* Course Goal
Upon completion of this course, students are expected to understand and apply
basic concepts in mathematical statistics. In particular, students will study
concepts of generating functions, limit theorems, sampling, parameter
estimation, Neyman-Pearson theory of hypothesis testing.

* Grades
Your course grade will be determined as follows:

| Category | Weight |
|----------+--------|
| Homework |    20% |
| Quizzes  |    20% |
| Midterm  |    25% |
| Final    |    35% |
|----------+--------|

Grades will be assigned according to the scale (but may be slightly adjusted):

A = 90-100, B = 72-89, C = 60-71, D = 50-59 and F = 0-50, with course components
weighted as listed above. Final grades will include +/-. A grade of I will only
be given to a student who is passing the course and cannot complete the course
due to illness or other well-documented circumstances beyond his/her control.

This grade assignment requires a passing grade in each exam, else the final
course grade is up to the discretion of the instructor. In order to obtain a
good course grade, students must successfully complete all homework assignments,
the exams and quizzes; attend every lecture; and actively participate in class.

* Homework

Approximately 9-12 homeworks will be assigned during the semester. Students may
consult amongst themselves or with the instructor or TA, but each student must
submit his/her own work. Some important notes on homework assignments:

- Homework assignments will encompass book problems of Chapters 6-10.
- Each homework assignment will be submitted via HuskyCT only. Two randomly
  selected problems will be graded and relevant exercises of HW will be
  discussed during the discussion section.
- Many problems on the exams will be based on the homework problems and examples
  discussed in lectures and discussions.
- Late submissions within the 2-day grace period will only be worth 50\% of the
  points. Submissions beyond 2 days will not be graded and will receive no
  credit.

# Unless stated, homework should be submitted through HuskyCT. Homework
# submissions *must contains a .pdf file* along with source code in .ipynb, .md,
# or .py format.

# Late submissions within the 2-day grace period will only be worth 50% - 95%
# of the points. Submissions beyond 2 days will not be graded and will receive
# no credit. No homework grade will be dropped.


# * HuskyCT

# All the exams must be taken and submitted through the HuskyCT on a
# pre-established schedule defined by the instructor. Exam submissions by email
# are not acceptable.

* Class sessions

Students are expected to attend the classes and discussions and engage in class
activities.

# * Tutoring

# The department offers free tutoring services for students. The
# schedule is listed on the following website: *TBA*

* Important notes
- This should not be your first course in Statistics.
- Working on all the exercise problems is recommended. You will not learn how to
  solve problems by merely watching someone else do them; you must do them on
  your own.
- Academic integrity is seriously regarded and academic misconduct has severe
  consequences.
- Final exam week for Spring 2025 is from *Mon May 5 - Sat, May 10*. Students are
  required to be available for their exam during the stated time. If you have a
  conflict with this time, you must visit the Dean of Students Office to discuss
  the possibility of rescheduling this exam.
- Please note that vacations, previously purchased tickets or reservations,
  social events, misreading the exam schedule and over-sleeping are not viable
  excuses for missing a final exam. If you think that your situation warrants
  permission to reschedule, please contact the Dean of Students Office with any
  questions. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
- If you have any questions on the course, do not ever hesitate to email me. I
  hope you have a great semester!

* Exams and quizzes
# The midterm exam will be held in class on Thursday, and the final exam will be
# held at UConn scheduled date. They are closed book and closed
# notes. *No Make-up Exams!* The following is tentative exam schedule.
The exams and quizzes will feature questions covering mathematical
details, conceptual understanding, and application of the procedures and
techniques learned. They may involve in-class portions, take-home portions, or a
mixture of the two. Missed exams cannot be made up unless with documentation of
reasons required by University policy. The Final Exam is cumulative. Here is a
tentative schedule for exams and quizzes:

- Quiz 1:  <2025-02-06 Thu>
- Midterm: <2025-03-06 Thu>.
- Quiz 2:  <2025-04-03 Thu>.
- Final:   TBA

# Pop quizzes may be given at any time during the semester. If you have to miss a
# lecture, you have to let me know before the class so that I will use the average
# of other quizzes to replace a missed quiz score. Otherwise, you will receive a 0
# for a missed quiz.

* Academic Integrity

A fundamental tenet of all educational institutions is academic honesty;
academic work depends upon respect for and acknowledgement of the research and
ideas of others. Misrepresenting someone else's work as one's own is a serious
offense in any academic setting and it will not be condoned. Academic misconduct
includes, but is not limited to, providing or receiving assistance in a manner
not authorized by the instructor in the creation of work to be submitted for
academic evaluation (e.g. papers, projects, and examinations); any attempt to
influence improperly (e.g. bribery, threats) any member of the faculty, staff,
or administration of the University in any matter pertaining to academics or
research; presenting, as one's own,the ideas or words of another for academic
evaluation; doing unauthorized academic work for which another person will
receive credit or be evaluated; and presenting the same or substantially the
same papers or projects in two or more courses without the explicit permission
of the instructors involved. A student who knowingly assists another student in
committing an act of academic misconduct shall be equally accountable for the
violation, and shall be subject to the sanctions and other remedies described in
The Student Code.
